a legal training app that teaches trading using public market data + a simulator with fake currency, and it grades/coach-users with scores, insights, and (optional) leaderboards. Think “Duolingo for trading,” but with charts, setups, and feedback.

Here’s a strong blueprint you can build in Python.

⸻

Core concept

Users never connect a brokerage.
They trade with paper money (fake balance) inside your app using real historical / delayed / (optionally) real-time market data. The app:
	•	teaches basics → intermediate → advanced
	•	gives “missions” (lessons) and practice challenges
	•	grades trades and decisions with a clear scoring rubric
	•	shows progress, streaks, ranks, and “what you did wrong”

This is legal as a trading education + simulation product, as long as you’re clear you’re not giving personalized investment advice.

Key features to build

1) Learn mode (structured curriculum)

Create tracks like:
	•	Stocks 101: market/limit orders, bid/ask, volatility, position sizing
	•	Crypto 101: spreads, slippage, news volatility, risk
	•	Technical basics: trend, support/resistance, volume, moving averages
	•	Risk management: stop loss, take profit, R:R, max loss per day
	•	Psychology: revenge trading, FOMO, overtrading

Each lesson ends with:
	•	a short quiz
	•	a mini-sim challenge (“Place a trade with a 2:1 risk-reward”)

2) Practice mode (paper trading simulator)
	•	Fake wallet: e.g., “SonoDollars” / “SimCash” / “Practice Credits”
	•	User can trade:
	•	“Market” and “Limit” (simulate fills)
	•	Stop-loss and take-profit
	•	“Replay mode”: pick a day and trade like it’s live (candles reveal gradually)

3) Feedback engine (what makes it feel premium)

After each trade, show:
	•	Entry quality (did you chase? buy into resistance? late entry?)
	•	Risk quality (position size too big? no stop? bad R:R?)
	•	Exit quality (took profit too early? held loser too long?)
	•	Execution quality (slippage/spread, limit vs market choice)

Make it feel like a coach that explains in simple English:

“You entered after price already moved 3.2% in 4 candles (chase). Your stop was 0.4% away in a high-volatility zone, so you got wicked out.”

4) Weekly/Daily “Trading Score”

Users love a single number + breakdown:
	•	Risk Score (0–100)
	•	Discipline Score (0–100)
	•	Strategy Fit Score (0–100)
	•	Execution Score (0–100)
	•	Overall Score (weighted)

5) Optional social layer
	•	Leaderboards by consistency (not raw profit)
	•	“Risk-adjusted league” so gamblers don’t dominate
	•	Private rooms for friends/classes

⸻

Scoring model (simple but powerful)

Your scoring should reward good habits, not luck.

Per-trade metrics

You can compute these from trade logs + price series:
	•	R multiple: profit / risk (risk = entry − stop for long)
	•	Max adverse excursion (MAE): how far it went against them
	•	Max favorable excursion (MFE): how far it went in their favor
	•	Chase score: entered after a big candle move
	•	Stop placement score: stop too tight for volatility (use ATR)
	•	Rule adherence: did they follow the lesson rules?

Example: scoring formula
	•	Risk discipline (40%): position sizing + max daily loss + stop usage
	•	Trade quality (30%): R multiple + entry/exit timing vs volatility
	•	Consistency (20%): avoids revenge trading, overtrading, tilt
	•	Learning (10%): quizzes + completing scenarios

Important: Leaderboard should be based on risk-adjusted score and consistency, not “who YOLO’d into a moonshot.”

⸻

Data approach (public data)

Start with:
	•	Daily OHLCV for stocks/ETFs
	•	Crypto OHLCV (minute/hour/day)
	•	Later: add delayed intraday if you want the “live feel”

Store:
	•	candles (open/high/low/close/volume)
	•	corporate actions if needed (splits/dividends) for stocks

⸻

Membership tiers (clean and convincing)

Free tier
	•	Basic lessons (Stocks 101 + intro crypto)
	•	Basic simulator (market orders, limited assets)
	•	Basic score + weekly recap
	•	No advanced feedback (just win/loss + simple tips)

Pro monthly/annual
	•	Full curriculum (risk, strategy types, psychology)
	•	Replay mode + scenarios
	•	Advanced feedback engine (ATR stops, chase detection, R-multiple coaching)
	•	More assets + watchlists
	•	Full analytics: heatmaps, consistency, mistake breakdown

Premium / Mentor (optional)
	•	Personalized “learning path” (still not investment advice)
	•	Deep trade review templates
	•	Private leaderboard/classroom mode for groups

⸻

Legal safety (how to phrase it)

You’ll want these principles everywhere:
	•	“Educational simulation only”
	•	“Not investment advice”
	•	“Past performance doesn’t predict future results”
	•	“No brokerage connection; trades are simulated”
	•	“We provide generalized educational feedback, not personalized recommendations”

Your premium features should be about process coaching, not “buy this now.”

Python architecture (what to build first)

MVP in 4 modules
	1.	Data service

	•	fetch/store candles
	•	serve candles by symbol/timeframe

	2.	Sim engine

	•	order fills (market/limit), fees, spreads
	•	portfolio, positions, PnL

	3.	Scoring engine

	•	compute metrics per trade + per week
	•	generate explanations (“reason codes” → human text)

	4.	App API

	•	FastAPI backend (clean for mobile + web)
	•	Postgres for users/trades
	•	Redis optional for caching

⸻

“Types of trading” you can teach (in-app tracks)

Give users lanes so they don’t feel lost:
	•	Long-term investing
	•	Swing trading
	•	Day trading (advanced)
	•	Momentum
	•	Mean reversion
	•	Breakouts
	•	Trend following
	•	News volatility (advanced + risk warnings)

Each track has:
	•	rules
	•	examples
	•	practice scenarios
	•	a scoring rubric tailored to it
